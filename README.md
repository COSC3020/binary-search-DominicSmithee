# Binary Search

I used GeekForGeeks.org to remember what a binary search function was, as well as how to find the middle element of an array in javascript.
I took advice from a fellow student Matt Goodnow to NOT try it recursively, which I stubbornley obeyed after 8 hours of struggle. 
I took guidance from freeCodeCamp.org and htmlcheatsheet.com to remember basic javascript syntax. 

I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use
of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated
otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is
suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.
